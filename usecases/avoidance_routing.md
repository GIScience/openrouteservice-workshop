# Avoidance Routing


One notable use case of openrouteservice is its ability to incorporate polygon geometries using the avoid_area option. This feature allows users to specify areas to be avoided during routing or isochrone calculations. While the primary application has been in disaster-related scenarios, such as avoiding affected areas, this functionality can also be employed for various purposes, such as scheduling routes to bypass no-go zones. A recent development building on top of the feature is the disaster portal, a web platform that enables organizations to centrally manage the areas to be avoided. Humanitarian organizations responding to the Syria-Turkey crisis, for instance, utilized this portal to mark and maintain closed borders and roads. This enabled the retrieval of alternative routes and supported on-site navigation and logistics.
