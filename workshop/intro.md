# Introduction 

In times of disaster, such as the devastating flood event that occurred in the Ahr valley in Germany in July 2021, **routing becomes crucial for emergency responders, humanitarian organizations, and disaster management teams** to distribute help quickly and efficiently. Openrouteservice, an open-source routing engine built on OpenStreetMap data, offers a **powerful** and **flexible** solution for **navigation** and **logistics** **planning** in such scenarios.

The coordinates provided in the code chunk point to the ***NÃ¼rburgring*, a motorsports complex in rural Rhineland-Palatinate, which served as staging area during the emergency response.** In this area, rescue helpers from all over Germany were stationed to sleep, eat and repair their equipment inbetween deployments. The destination coordinates point to ***Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler***, the largest community affected by the flood in Rhineland-Palatinate.


This training aims to **familiarize participants with the capabilities of openrouteservice within Python** and demonstrate how it can be leveraged to address routing challenges during a disaster. Through a series of code examples we will explore the key features and functionalities of openrouteservice. You will learn how easy it is to interact with openrouteservice from Python and be able to integrate it directly into your own workflow.
